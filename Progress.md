### Weeks 1-3:

Through weeks 1-3 I created a demo Chrome Extension that recognizes a face in a Youtube video and overlays an emoji indicating the emotion of the face. This iteration utilizes two open source frameworks for Facial and Emotion recognition, [Face-API.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js?files=1) and [FrontEnd-EmotionDetection](https://github.com/kevinisbest/FrontEnd-EmotionDetection) respectively. 

## Week 1: 

The first week consisted namely of setting up the Chrome Extension to allow for content script injections. This allows the extension to interact with the web page anytime a Youtube Video is loaded. From here I injected a button into the Youtube Player that would indicate whent to start looking for emotions in the video.
