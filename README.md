## Description

I am currently taking CPSC 491 working on a project with CDM to build an interactive toy robot to help children with Autism. For these directed studies credits, I be taking on an extension to this project, building on concepts covered in CPSC 340 and CPSC 425. This project extension would be to implement a Chrome Extension that processes face emotions in youtube videos being watched in real time. This feature will be integrated with the toy robot we are building in the project in order to highlight emotions in the video. The goal is for this to be used as an aid to help teach emotion interpretation and engagement at a young age, and in a very inexpensive and accessible way. This is somewhat inspired from the [Autism Glass Project](http://autismglass.stanford.edu/), hopefully providing another aid for emotion interpretation development in an environment that is both comfortable and engaging for the children.
