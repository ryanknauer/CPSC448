        "Our previous HMM implementation only expected a single valued observation, however our CNN actually provides a probability distribution for each possible emotional state. In order to incorporate this probabilistic observation returned by the CNN we need to tweak the update step of the filtering process to accommodate this change. Filtering is a recursive algorithm used to find the probability of a state given a sensor observation of that state(observation step) and predicted probability of the prior state(recursive step). We also use a transition matrix which models the probability of transitioning from one state to another. \n",
        "\n",
        "In respects to this project, the observation step would be our CNN predicting the emotional state from a given frame. The 'recursive' step would be finding probability of the previous state by the same recursive filtering algorithm. In our case, we would be iterating from the first frame so these values do not need to be recursively recomputed. The observation matrix represents the probability of our CNN observation model predicting a certain value given a known actual emotional state. The transition matrix represents the probability of an emotional state transitioning from one to another between a single frame. The update step then combines these two probabilities using the transition and observation matrices, giving a prediction for the underlying hidden emotional state. The below diagram outlines this HMM structure:\n",
