[Brandon Rohrer - "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCUNPb-5EYI&t=713s)
This video gives a high level overview of both RNNs and LSTMs. I felt this did a great job of covering the intuition behind why RNN and LSTMs are useful which I find to be a large learning barrier with many of this more dense conceptual models.
